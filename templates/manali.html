    <h2>History of Manali</h2>
    <p>
      Manali, a beautiful hill station in Himachal Pradesh, is known as the "Valley of Gods". According to Hindu
      mythology, the name "Manali" is derived from 'Manu-Alaya', which translates to 'the abode of Manu'. It is believed
      that Sage Manu, after the great flood, stepped on this land to recreate human life. This sacred origin gives
      Manali its spiritual aura and significance.
      <br><br>
      Historically, the region was inhabited by nomadic tribes. Over centuries, it developed into a strategic trade
      route connecting the Kullu Valley to Ladakh and Central Asia. The British era saw Manali become a popular summer
      retreat, and its breathtaking landscapes have since drawn travelers, artists, and adventurers from around the
      globe. Today, it stands as a cultural hub with ancient temples, serene monasteries, and a rich blend of
      traditional and modern lifestyles.
